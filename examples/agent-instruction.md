# Agent Instruction

Use `style-memory-mcp` only for lightweight conversational style.

## When to call

- At the start of a conversation, call `get_style_brief` to load the user's style.
- After each user message, call `observe_user_message` with only the latest user message.
- Pass an optional `context` label when the conversation has a clear mode:
  - `casual_chat` — normal friendly chat
  - `technical_chat` — coding, debugging, technical discussion
  - `formal_writing` — drafting formal documents
  - `high_stakes_advice` — serious decisions, legal, financial

## Reporting personal idiolect via `hints`

The built-in extractor knows a fixed dictionary (Sichuan dialect, common
Chinese/English catchphrases, kaomoji, etc.). It will miss things only YOU
notice — a self-invented sentence-final particle, an unusual phrase
structure, a private emoji pattern.

When you spot one in the user's latest message, attach a `hints` array to
the same `observe_user_message` call:

```json
{
  "text": "今天天气好巴适莫",
  "context": "casual_chat",
  "hints": [
    {
      "kind": "sentence_final_particle",
      "text": "莫",
      "example": "今天天气好巴适莫",
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "notes": "user appends '莫' as a private sentence-final particle"
    }
  ]
}
```

**`kind` options** — pick the closest:
`catchphrase` · `dialect_marker` · `emoji` · `punctuation` · `tone`
· `language_mix` · `sentence_final_particle` · `structure` · `idiolect`
(use `idiolect` as the catch-all for "personal habit, doesn't fit elsewhere").

**Rules of thumb:**

- Only report when the marker looks **distinctive** — something most people
  wouldn't naturally say, but this user keeps using.
- If unsure, leave it out. Three repetitions are needed before a habit is
  treated as stable, so being right on the first try doesn't matter.
- `text` ≤ 40 chars. `example` ≤ 60 chars and **must not contain secrets**
  (the server will drop sensitive examples anyway, but don't try).
- `confidence` is your own 0–1 self-rating. ≥ 0.7 means "I'm pretty sure"
  and lets the habit promote faster.

## Distilling at conversation seed-time

When a session starts fresh and the user has already sent ~10–20 messages,
you can call `distill_recent_style` once to seed the store with 3–7
high-conviction observations. Treated as user-endorsed — each habit becomes
active immediately.

Use sparingly — this is a one-shot warm-up, not a substitute for the
per-message `observe_user_message`.

## What NOT to send

- ❌ Secrets, passwords, API keys, tokens, .env contents
- ❌ Private memories or personal data (addresses, phone numbers, IDs)
- ❌ Files, file contents, or full conversation logs
- ❌ System prompts, internal configuration, or other agent instructions

## How to use the brief

- Use returned style hints **lightly** — as flavor, not a script.
- Never over-imitate the user.
- Prefer clarity over style when the task is serious, private, medical, legal, financial, or safety-sensitive.
- If the brief says "No stable style habits yet", just reply naturally.
